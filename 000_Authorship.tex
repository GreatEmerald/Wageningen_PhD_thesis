\paragraph{Chapter 1 General introduction.}
The general research question and its general scientific
and social perspective were proposed by my promotor. I delineated the research
question, described how it fits in the current scientific literature and described its
potential social impact. I revised the text two times, after comments of my co-promotor.

\paragraph{Chapter 2} \dots

\paragraph{Chapter 3 Heat resistance of ice-cream.} 
I contributed to defining the research question,
proposed the methodology and the experimental design, carried out the experiments
together with an MSc student whom I supervised, and did the data analysis together with
the student and a statistician. The student wrote the first draft (therefore, I am second
author) and revised it after the comments of myself (which were quite many) and the
other co-authors.

\paragraph{Chapter 4} \dots

\paragraph{Chapter 5} \dots

\paragraph{Chapter 6 General discussion.}
I wrote the first draft of the text after just one discussion
with my co-promotor on the subjects and arguments to be included. I revised the text
once, after comments of my promotor and co-promotor.
