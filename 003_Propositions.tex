\subsection*{Propositions}

\begin{enumerate}[wide]
    \item The general assumption that the mesophyll conductance to carbon dioxide in leaves of
green plants is infinite cannot be maintained.
(this thesis)
    \item The partitioning of excited electrons to photosystems I and II is unbalanced in plants
suffering from severe drought stress.
(this thesis)
    \item Zinc biofortification of cereals through plant breeding is inefficient, especially in the
case of wheat.
    \item For the analysis of the crop physiological background of tuber size distribution in
potato it is essential to analyse phenomena of tuber set and tuber bulking at the level
of the individual plant.
    \item Moral acceptance of techniques of genetic modification plays a much smaller role in
the debate on genetically modified organisms than proponents of such techniques
assume.
    \item The current debate in literature on the question whether green plants are intelligent
suggests that plants might have a greater ability to perceive signals from their
environment and to learn from these signals than some scientists do.
